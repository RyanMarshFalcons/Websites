                &emsp;&emsp; The idea to start the Paws For Thought dog grooming business has been an idea of ours since 2016. Tania, Danielle, and Ryan have all had dogs for as long as they can remember and have had extensive experience caring for their dogs. We've found that a big part of caring for dogs is also making sure they get a proper amount of exercise, which is why we also inclde a comprehensive dog walking serivce.
                <br /> <br /> <br />
                &emsp;&emsp; We officially began operations in Septemember of 2018, servicing the Orlando area. We have received a lot of positive feedback from customers as well as suggestions of additional services we could offer that we plan to implement in the near future.
