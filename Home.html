                &emsp;&emsp; Established in 2018, Paws For Thought is a privately owned family operated mobile dog grooming company based in the Orlando area. We offer a variety of grooming services including bathing, blowdrying, nail trimming, ear cleaning, haircuts, and dog walking. We also perform a moderate health check at the start of every appointment because we care about your dog's health and want to alert you of any problems that we can find.
                <br /> <br /> <br />
                &emsp;&emsp; As lifelong dog lovers who have always had furry family members we understand that your dog's well being is very important to you and we take you entrusting their care to us very seriously.
                <br /> <br /> <br />
                &emsp;&emsp; Customer satisfaction is our top priority. We want you to have confidence in using our services again and again. We strive to deliver you all the dog grooming services you need for your dog at your convenience for an affordable price.
                <br /> <br /> <br />
                &emsp;&emsp; Your time is valuable. When you book an appointment with Paws For Thought we come to you and provide a full range of grooming services in our customized truck parked outside your home at the scheduled time. You can count on us and won't be disappointed.
